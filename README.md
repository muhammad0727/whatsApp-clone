ChitChat: Project Architecture & System DesignThis document outlines the architecture for ChitChat, a real-time messaging, calling, and payments application.1. Core PrinciplesScalability: The architecture must support millions of concurrent users. This is achieved through a microservices-oriented approach, horizontal scaling, and efficient real-time communication protocols.Reliability: The system must guarantee message delivery and maintain high availability.Security: End-to-end encryption (E2EE) for messages and calls is paramount. All financial transactions must be processed securely through trusted payment gateways.Real-time: Communication must be instantaneous.2. Technology StackThis stack is chosen for performance, scalability, and robust community support.Backend Language: Python 3.10+Framework: FastAPI for high-performance REST APIs and WebSocket handling.Real-time Communication: WebSockets for messaging and signaling.ORM: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with asyncio support for database interaction.Task Queue: Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ for background tasks (e.g., sending notifications, processing payments).Frontend (Mobile App): Flutter / React NativeWhy not Python? While Python is excellent for the backend, it is not used for building high-performance, native mobile applications. Frameworks like Kivy exist but lack the performance, stability, and ecosystem of Flutter (Dart) or React Native (JavaScript), which are the industry standards for cross-platform app development. You will need to build the mobile app separately using one of these frameworks.Database:Primary DB: PostgreSQL or YugabyteDB for relational data (users, group metadata, contacts, payment records).Caching/Message Broker: Redis for caching user sessions, presence status, and as a message broker for Celery.Chat History: ScyllaDB or Apache Cassandra for storing massive volumes of chat messages, optimized for high write throughput.Audio/Video Calling: WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between clients for low-latency calls.Our Python backend will run a Signaling Server (using WebSockets) to coordinate the connection setup (exchanging network info, SDP offers/answers) between users.A STUN/TURN Server (e.g., Coturn) will be needed to help devices traverse network NATs.Deployment & DevOps:Containerization: DockerOrchestration: KubernetesCloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.3. System Architecture OverviewThe system is composed of several key services:API Gateway: The single entry point for all client requests. It routes traffic to the appropriate microservice.User Service: Manages user authentication (signup, login, profile management), contacts, and presence status.Messaging Service:Manages WebSocket connections for real-time messaging.Routes messages between users and groups.Stores messages in the chat history database (Cassandra/ScyllaDB).Group Service: Manages all group-related logic: creating groups, adding/removing members, and managing the new Roles feature.Calling Service (Signaling Server): Manages the WebRTC signaling process to establish audio/video calls.Payment Service: Integrates with Pakistani payment gateways (JazzCash, EasyPaisa, etc.) to handle secure payment transfers.Notification Service: Sends push notifications to mobile clients (via Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service) when the app is in the background.4. Feature Deep Dive: Group Admin RolesThis is a unique feature that extends standard group functionality.Database SchemaIn our group_members table, we will add a role column.CREATE TABLE group_members (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    group_id INTEGER REFERENCES groups(id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'participant', -- 'participant', 'moderator', 'editor', etc.
    added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Roles & Permissions LogicThe backend will define a set of permissions for each role. This can be stored in a configuration file or a database table.Example Roles:admin: Can do everything (add/remove members, change group info, assign roles, delete messages).moderator: Can remove members and delete messages.participant: Can send messages and media.When a user attempts an action (e.g., remove a member), the API endpoint will check the user's role and associated permissions before allowing the action.API EndpointsPOST /groups/{group_id}/members/assign_role: Allows an admin to assign a role to one or more members.Body: {"members": [{"user_id": 123, "role": "moderator"}]}5. Payment Integration WorkflowIntegrating with services like JazzCash or EasyPaisa follows a standard API-based workflow.Initiate Transfer (Client -> Backend): The user enters the recipient's details and the amount in the app. The app sends this request to our backend.Request Gateway (Backend -> Payment Gateway): Our backend securely sends a payment request to the chosen payment gateway's API, including credentials and transaction details.User Authentication (Client <-> Gateway): The payment gateway may require the user to authenticate, often via an OTP sent to their phone or through the gateway's app. Our app must handle this step.Confirmation (Payment Gateway -> Backend): The gateway sends a webhook/callback to our backend to confirm the transaction status (success or failure).Finalize (Backend -> Client): Our backend updates its records, logs the transaction, and informs both the sender and receiver of the result via a system message in their chat.
